# Subbydoo
Main purpose of the app is to help people finding appropriate subtitles for their Movie/TV-Show match from multiple subtitle sources.

Main goal is adding OpenSubtitles, Titlovi.com, Podnapisi.net and yts-subs.com, others might come.

some of the functions that are in plan:
- user login
- choosing multiple languages
- download inside the app itself
- rating the subtitle file

The app is in its early alpha, so not much to see yet.

Every advice and help is more than welcome.
